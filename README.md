## Customer Service App C#

It's a customer service app builded in C# that can read data from the database.
I used MySQL ODBC Drivers (MySQL ODBC Connector/ODBC is a standardized database driver for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Unix platforms)
I also have some extra features to be mentioned below

### Guide

1. drop the project into the source\repos folder
2. import the database to your database management system that you can find in the DB folder
3. Open the Solution with the Visual Studio 
4. And that's it.

When you start the App the first form that you will see is the connection form.
You must fill the fields with the appropriate informations.
